FTDI drivers, also known as FTDI USB drivers, are a set of 
device drivers used in Windows operating systems to enable 
communication between a computer and a USB device that uses
an FTDI (Future Technology Devices International) USB-to-serial converter chip.

FTDI drivers are commonly used in devices that require a USB-to-serial
interface, such as Arduino boards, 3D printers, and various types of industrial
equipment. The drivers allow the USB device to communicate with the computer 
through a serial interface using a virtual COM port.

In Windows, the FTDI drivers are typically installed automatically when the
USB device is connected to the computer for the first time. However, if the
drivers are not installed or if there are issues with the drivers, the device
may not work properly or may not be recognized by the computer.

To troubleshoot issues with FTDI drivers in Windows, you may need 
to uninstall and reinstall the drivers, update the drivers to the latest 
version, or check for any conflicts with other software or hardware on 
the computer. In some cases, you may also need to adjust the device 
settings or configure the device to use a different COM port.

Overall, FTDI drivers are an important component in enabling 
communication between a USB device and a computer, and understanding
how they work and how to troubleshoot issues with them can help ensure
that your devices function properly.
