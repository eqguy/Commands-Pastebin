The Core Isolation feature in Windows Security is a security option that 
helps protect your computer from malware attacks that target your computer
's memory. Core Isolation uses virtualization technology to create a secure
area in memory that is isolated from the rest of the system. This secure area
is called a "virtualization-based security container" and it is protected by
hardware-based security features that are built into modern CPUs.

When Core Isolation is enabled, Windows uses the Windows Hypervisor to create
a virtual machine (VM) that runs a minimal operating system with only the 
essential drivers and services needed to support the virtual machine. This 
isolated environment ensures that any malware or other malicious code that
may have infected your computer's memory cannot access the system resources
outside of the virtual machine.

Additionally, the Core Isolation feature also includes a Memory Integrity 
option that helps protect your computer from attacks that attempt to modify
system files in memory. This feature uses virtualization-based security to
prevent unauthorized changes to the memory space of critical system components,
such as the Windows kernel, system drivers, and security modules.

Enabling Core Isolation in Windows Security is a good security practice that can
help protect your computer from sophisticated malware attacks. However, it is 
important to note that not all systems support this feature. Before enabling it,
you should check if your computer meets the hardware requirements, which include 
a CPU that supports virtualization-based security and second-level address 
translation (SLAT) technology.
